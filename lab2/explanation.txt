Hello,

I was unable to attend Lab 2 because I attended a field trip to Dropbox at their San Francisco office. I was out there from 10:00am to 3:30pm. I was behind other assignments since I also spend the majority of Monday at PayPal headquarters, and I also attended the STEM career fair that happened on Wednesday. In other words, it was a very busy week. I can provide proofs for the trips if necessary.

Thank you!
